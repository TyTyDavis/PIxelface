# PixelFace
## Goal
1. To create a Python app that will take a photo of a face as an input, and output a pixel art version of that photo.
2. To create a web interface for that application.



## Notes
Maybe find that simple face detection algorithm, build a palette from the face, and then black out the face, build a small palette from the rest of the image
